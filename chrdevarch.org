* Introduction
  The data of char device just can be accessed as a stream, read/write it one by one, in other word, you can't random access the data from char device, which is the diffrence with block device.\\
  heree, we will show how to write a char device driver, and to study linux char device driver in deeper level --- to analize the relationship between file system and char device driver. we'll to show how to access char device in user space in next section.
** Accress from user space
   In Linux, everything is a file, that means device can be accessed as a special type of file. you can call open() to get the file handle, and call read() to get data frome the device. in linux system, device node always be created in /dev directory, but it not means you must create it in the directory, you can create it in any directory, e.g., /tmp.\\
   A device can access as the way mentioned above, and it has some differance with a nomal file, for a char device, we can use ioctl() to send cmd to device driver, and use mmap() to map memory from kernel space to user space, then the memory can access in user sapce directly.
** How to write a char device driver
   To write a char device driver, need to define a variable in the type of struct file\_operations, and initialize it with functions defied in driver, in the callback of \_\_init, you can call register\_chrdev() with MAJOR and file\_operations variable parameter to register a char device. after the step, you can mknode with MAJOR and access it with open/read/write fuctions in userspace.
   It look likes very simple to complete a char device driver, Yes, it is so simple!
* Char Device File System Init
  There is a chrdev\_init() function in the file char\_dev.c, char device file system is initialized here, the first thing in this function to do is initializing the kobj\_map with kobj\_map\_init() function, the struct kboj\_map is defined as following:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
struct kobj_map {
	struct probe {
		struct probe *next;
		dev_t dev;
		unsigned long range;
		struct module *owner;
		kobj_probe_t *get;
		int (*lock)(dev_t, void *);
		void *data;
	} *probes[255];
	struct mutex *lock;
};
#+END_SRC
The number of array probes is defined as MAX major number for char device, so the max major number for char device is 255.
** kobj\_map init
the result of calling kobj\_map\_init() is as the following graph showd.\\
[[kobj_map_init.png]]
** The analices of register\_chrdev()
+ to call \_\_register\_chrdev\_region() to alloc a major not used and make chardevs[major] point to a new aclloced variable in type of struct char\_device\_struct.
#+BEGIN_SRC C
static struct char_device_struct {
	struct char_device_struct *next;
	unsigned int major;
	unsigned int baseminor;
	int minorct;
	char name[64];
	struct cdev *cdev;		/* will die */
} *chrdevs[CHRDEV_MAJOR_HASH_SIZE];
#+END_SRC
+ to call cdev\_alloc to alloc a struct cdev variable and fill the fileds with fops and name passed in 
+ then call cdev\_add() to add the char device.
in cdev\_add() function, called kobj\_map() to add a probe to cdev\_map, which the probe with the field be filled with MKDEV(major, 0), the major is the major number of the char device. what happend as showed in following graph.\\

* Opening A Device File
** The interface with file system
def\_chr\_fops is defined in char\_dev.c as following:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
const struct file_operations def_chr_fops = {
	.open = chrdev_open,
	.llseek = noop_llseek,
};
#+END_SRC
and the def\_chr\_fops assigned to inode->i\_fops in init\_special\_inode()
#+BEGIN_SRC C
void init_special_inode(struct inode *inode, umode_t mode, dev_t rdev)
{
	inode->i_mode = mode;
	if (S_ISCHR(mode)) {
		inode->i_fop = &def_chr_fops;
		inode->i_rdev = rdev;
	} else if (S_ISBLK(mode)) {
		inode->i_fop = &def_blk_fops;
		inode->i_rdev = rdev;
	} else if (S_ISFIFO(mode))
		inode->i_fop = &def_fifo_fops;
	else if (S_ISSOCK(mode))
		inode->i_fop = &bad_sock_fops;
	else
		printk(KERN_DEBUG "init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (%o) for"
				  " inode %s:%lu\n", mode, inode->i_sb->s_id,
				  inode->i_ino);
}
#+END_SRC

** What have been done in chrdev\_open()
The detail please see the comment in following code.
#+BEGIN_SRC C
static int chrdev_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
{
	struct cdev *p;
	struct cdev *new = NULL;
	int ret = 0;

	spin_lock(&cdev_lock);
	p = inode->i_cdev;
	if (!p) {
		struct kobject *kobj;
		int idx;
		spin_unlock(&cdev_lock);
		kobj = kobj_lookup(cdev_map, inode->i_rdev, &idx); // to lookup kobj in cdev_map with major and minor number
		if (!kobj)
			return -ENXIO;
		new = container_of(kobj, struct cdev, kobj);
		spin_lock(&cdev_lock);
		/* Check i_cdev again in case somebody beat us to it while
		   we dropped the lock. */
		p = inode->i_cdev;
		if (!p) {
			inode->i_cdev = p = new;
			list_add(&inode->i_devices, &p->list);
			new = NULL;
		} else if (!cdev_get(p))
			ret = -ENXIO;
	} else if (!cdev_get(p))
		ret = -ENXIO;
	spin_unlock(&cdev_lock);
	cdev_put(new);
	if (ret)
		return ret;

	ret = -ENXIO;
	/* get file_operations defined in driver and assigned to filp->f_op,
	when user call read/write in user space, it will call read/write define in driver directly.*/
	filp->f_op = fops_get(p->ops);
	if (!filp->f_op)
		goto out_cdev_put;

	if (filp->f_op->open) {
		ret = filp->f_op->open(inode, filp); // call open defined in driver
		if (ret)
			goto out_cdev_put;
	}

	return 0;

 out_cdev_put:
	cdev_put(p);
	return ret;
}
